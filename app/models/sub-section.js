	"description": "<p class=\"colum-content\">Having good clean markup and styles is imperative for a smooth operating application.  My approach is to build <strong>simple reusable structures</strong>, starting at a basic level and getting more granular as needed so as not to repeat work.</p><p class=\"colum-content\">For styles, I prefer using tools like <strong>Stylus</strong> or <strong>SASS</strong> which compile to CSS3, because they are more readable and structured.  Similarly, using <strong>Handlebars</strong>, JSTL, or other templating libraries which render to HTML5 can dramatically reduce a code base and make it more maintainable.</p><p class=\"colum-content\">My favorite part about CSS3 is the ability to add animation without touching Javascript.  Animations make for better interface by giving context to the user. </p>",

Iâ€™ve used Grunt to take this to the next level, automatically updating the DOM with each saved change.  This site was built using Ember App Kit and the styles and Javascript has been minified into production ready code using Grunt.</p><p class=\"colum-content\"></p>",
