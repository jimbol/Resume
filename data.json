I use all these skills in my work and I relish it. \n I have been developing for over 6 years with my primary focus being server and client javascript development, feature architecture, and project leadership. I care about delivering well tested, performant, maintainable code and building tooling to enable others to do the same.\nVarious experiences have led me to concentrate on JavaScript as my primary language. The trends with JavaScript are thrilling to use and participate in. I thrive in this environment of new technology but also I crave a deeper knowledge of other languages and applications of software. My favorite pastime is to explore these and so I have dabbled with Python, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi.\n"
