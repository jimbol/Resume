Similarly, using Handlebars, JSTL, or other templating libraries which render to HTML5 can dramatically reduce a code base and make it more maintainable.</p><p class=\"colum-content\">My favorite part about CSS3 is the ability to add animation without touching Javascript.  Animations make for better interface by giving context to the user. </p>",
